## Introduction

The Real-Time Malware Detection System is a Python-based application that captures network packets, extracts relevant features, and uses a machine-learning model to classify the packets as benign or malicious. It is intended for use in network security to provide real-time monitoring and threat detection.

## Features

- **Real-Time Packet Sniffing**: Capture and analyze network packets on the fly.
- **Machine Learning**: Uses a pre-trained model to classify network traffic.
- **User Interface**: Intuitive Gradio interface for monitoring and interacting with the system.
- **Scalability**: Suitable for both small and large-scale network environments.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Operating System**: Windows, macOS, or Linux.
- **Python**: Python 3.8 or higher.
- **Virtual Environment** (recommended): `venv`, `virtualenv`, or `conda` to manage dependencies.

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/real-time-malware-detection.git
cd real-time-malware-detection
```

### Set Up the Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Download the Pre-trained Model

1. Download the pre-trained machine learning model from the provided link.
2. Place the model file (`model.pkl`) in the project’s root directory.

## Usage

### Running the Application

1. **Activate the virtual environment** (if not already activated):

    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

2. **Start the application**:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

3. **Access the Interface**:
   - The application will run locally on `http://127.0.0.1:7861`.
   - Open this URL in your web browser to access the Gradio interface.

4. **Begin Packet Sniffing**:
   - Click the "Start Sniffing" button to begin capturing and analyzing network traffic.
   - View real-time logs and results in the interface.

### Stopping the Application

- Stop the application by pressing `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.

## Configuration

- **Network Interface**: You may need to configure the network interface in the `packet_sniffing.py` file to match your system’s interface name.

## Machine Learning Model

- **Training**: The model is trained on a labeled dataset of network traffic. You can retrain the model using your own dataset by following the instructions in the `model_training.py` file.
- **Model File**: Ensure the `model.pkl` file is placed in the root directory before running the application.

## Dependencies

The project uses the following Python libraries:

- `scapy`: For packet sniffing and network traffic analysis.
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and feature extraction.
- `scikit-learn`: For machine learning model handling.
- `gradio`: For creating the user interface.
- `httpx`: For handling HTTP requests.

Install all dependencies using the command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
